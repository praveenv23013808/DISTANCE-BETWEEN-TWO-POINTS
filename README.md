# 1c.DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:Giving values to the point x1 and x2
### Step 2:Giving values to the points y1 and y2
### Step 3:Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4:Calculating the distance using normal method to make the code simple 
### Step 5: At last, print the distance value
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
l2=[10,6]
l1=[4,2]
d=math.sqrt((((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2)))
print('{:.2f}'.format(d))
```
### OUTPUT:
